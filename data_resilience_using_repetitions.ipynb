        "There are many use-cases that can be implemented using LoRaWAN protocol, but I would focus on one of the most challenging ones: water metering.\n",
        "\n",
        "Everynet customers are primarily interested in service, whereby SLA is expressed solely by the availability of meter readings in the customer’s database or ERP system.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a typical SLA for a metering project is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        " - 97% of meters must be connected to an ERP system;\n",
        " - 95% of daily consumption datapoints should eventually be available in an ERP system.\n",
        " \n",
        "The percentage numbers could be different, but neither “network availability” nor “signal quality”, nor \"message loss\", nor the applied connectivity technology is involved in this data-driven SLA definition. \n",
        "\n",
        "Customers are only referring to the availability of meter readings and the percentage of sensors covered by the network. \n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, any other SLA definition leads to a dilution of responsibility, unnecessary delving into the technical details, and does not correspond to the needs of the customer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Coverage availability** is something that network operator suppose to deliver, while **datapoints availability** is something that can be significanlty improved by the solution provider and device manufacturer."
